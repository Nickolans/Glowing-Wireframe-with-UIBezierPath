# Glowing-Wireframe-with-UIBezierPath
This project illustrates how you can use UIBezierPath to create a glowing-wrireframe effect in iOS.

The project comes with two paths. One to create a christmas tree and another to create an N (the first letter of my name). You can of course use your own paths.
